# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT VARIABLES (VITE_ prefix)
# ===========================================

# Disable authentication for local development
# Set to 'true' to skip authentication (useful for local development)
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT set this in production (leave unset or set to 'false')
VITE_DISABLE_AUTH=true

# Fallback registration code for local development testing
# Only used when VITE_DISABLE_AUTH is not 'true' and server API is unavailable
# For production, use the server-side REGISTRATION_CODE instead
VITE_REGISTRATION_CODE=your-local-dev-code-here

# ===========================================
# PRODUCTION VARIABLES (Vercel Environment)
# ===========================================
# These are set in Vercel Dashboard > Project Settings > Environment Variables
# They are NOT prefixed with VITE_ so they stay server-side only
#
# REGISTRATION_CODE - Secret code for passkey registration (server-side only)
#   Set this in Vercel to keep it secure and hidden from clients
#
# DISABLE_REGISTRATION - Set to 'true' to block new passkey registrations
#   Useful after you've registered your own passkey to prevent others from registering
